Shopping Cart Web Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objective:
		Create a simple Shopping Cart web page using HTML and CSS that displays products and allows users to view selected items in their cart.  A well-structured web page that visually looks like a small online store with a shopping cart layout — no actual functionality (like adding items) is required.


Requirements:

1. Page Structure (HTML):

   * Create a main page titled “My Shopping Cart”.
   * Display at least 5-6 products.
   * Each product should include:

     * Product image
     * Product name
     * Short description
     * Price
     * A “Add to Cart” button (only for design, no JavaScript needed).
    

2. Styling (CSS):

   * Use a responsive layout (use Flexbox or Grid).
   * Style product cards with borders, shadows, and padding.
   * Use a consistent color scheme (e.g., pastel or minimal theme).
   * Make buttons look interactive (hover effects).
   * Ensure text is readable and neatly aligned.

3. Other Requirements :

   * Add a navigation bar with links like “Home”, “Shop”, “Cart”, “Contact”.
   * Add a footer with simple copyright text.
   * Include a responsive design so it looks good on mobile and desktop.
   * Add required semantic tags from HTML
